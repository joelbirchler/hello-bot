;; This is a sketch of what a turn-right-on-bump program might look like

(defn on-bump [leds car]
  (blink! (:yellow-led leds))
  (>> (reverse car) 500)
  (>> (turn-right car) 20))

(defn play [leds car bumper]
  (go-loop []
    (>> (forward! car))
    (when (= :bumped (<! bumper))
      (on-bump leds car))
    (recur)))
